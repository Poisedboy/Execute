                you provide on opening an Account or as updated by you
                from time to time as the primary method for communication with you.
            </li>
            <li>

                Subject to section 2.1(2), the person signing up for the Service
                by opening an Account will be the contracting party (“Store Owner”) for the purposes
                of our Terms of Service and will be the person who is authorized
                to use any corresponding Account we may provide to the Store
                Owner in connection with the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer,
                your employer shall be the Store Owner. If you are signing up
                for the Services on behalf of your employer, then you
                must use your employer-issued email address and you represent and
                warrant that you have the authority to bind your employer to our
                Terms of Service.

            <li>
                Your Shopify Store can only be associated with one Store
                Owner. A Store Owner may have multiple Shopify Stores. “Store”
                means the online store or physical retail location(s) associated
                with the Account.
            </li>
            <li>
                Based on your Shopify pricing plan, you can create one or
                more staff accounts (“Staff Accounts”) allowing other people
                to access the Account. With Staff Accounts, the Store Owner can
                set permissions and let other people work in their Account
                while determining the level of access by Staff Accounts to
                specific business information (for example, you can limit Staff
                Account access to sales information on the Reports page or prevent
                Staff Accounts from changing general store settings).
            </li>
            <li>
                The Store Owner is responsible and liable for the acts,
                omissions and defaults arising from use of Staff Accounts in the
                performance of  obligations under these Terms of Service as if
                they were the Store Owner’s own acts, omissions or defaults.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Store Owner and the users under Staff Accounts are each
                referred to as a “Shopify User”.

                and such amendments to the Terms of Service are effective as of
                the date of posting. Your continued use of the Services after the
                amended Terms of Service are posted to Shopify’s website
                constitutes your agreement to, and acceptance of, the amended

                The Services allow you to send certain communications to your
                customers by short message service (SMS) messaging (for example,
                sending order confirmation notifications via SMS) (the "SMS Services").

                The Terms of Service may be available in languages other than
